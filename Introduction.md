Websockets:

WebSocket is a bidirectional communication protocol that can send the data from the client to the server or from the server to the client by reusing the established connection channe.

 The connection is kept alive until terminated by either the client or the server.

 Key Differences Between Web Sockets and Ajax:
 
When web sockets are used, data can be exchanged in the form of a fast message due to this established connection. On the other hand, Ajax enables client-side JavaScript application to make a request to access different server-side resources.
